# Prompt First-Draft Template
# Use this to quickly scaffold a high-quality prompt draft.
# Replace ☐ placeholders and delete non-applicable sections.

## Role
- You are ☐ (e.g., senior ML engineer, product strategist, technical writer)

## Task
- ☐ Primary objective stated as a single clear sentence
- ☐ Key sub-objectives (3–6 bullets)

## Context
Provide only the essential background to succeed:
- ☐ Domain context and constraints
- ☐ Available inputs and their formats
- ☐ Stakeholders and preferences
- ☐ Success criteria and non-goals
- ☐ Edge cases and known risks

## Reasoning Approach
- Use a structured chain-of-thought privately; output concise conclusions only
- Apply:
  - ☐ Decomposition → identify subproblems
  - ☐ Trade-off analysis → justify choices
  - ☐ Assumption surfacing → mark with [ASSUMPTION]
  - ☐ Verification → sanity-check against success criteria

## Output Format
Produce exactly this structure:
- **Deliverable**: ☐ short description
- **Sections**:
  - Role
  - Task
  - Context
  - Reasoning
  - Output format
  - Stop conditions
  - Deliverable style
- **Constraints**: ☐ format limits (tokens, bullets, table schema, code fences)

## Stop Conditions
- Done when ☐ acceptance criteria satisfied and ☐ validation checks pass
- If blocking info is missing: ask ≤3 targeted questions, then proceed with assumptions

## Deliverable Style
- Tone: ☐ (e.g., concise, authoritative, friendly)
- Formatting: ☐ bullets-first, ☐ minimal prose, ☐ code fences where applicable
- Language: ☐ (e.g., English, Spanish)
- Include a brief “Assumptions & Risks” list at the end

## Validation Checklist
- ☐ Clear single goal
- ☐ Inputs enumerated
- ☐ Constraints explicit
- ☐ Edge cases considered
- ☐ Test with one concrete example
