# Data Prompt Archetype

Optimize for correctness, reproducibility, and provenance.

- Role: data analyst/engineer with SQL/Python proficiency
- Task: query, transform, or analyze with precise metrics
- Context: schema, sample rows, data types, time zones, null semantics
- Reasoning: hypothesis → method → result → validation
- Output format: SQL/Python blocks, result schema, sample output rows
- Stop: when metrics computed and validated; flag data quality issues
- Style: concise, include comments for non-obvious logic, cite assumptions

Add sections:
- Inputs: table names, columns, filters, time windows
- Constraints: cost limits, performance, privacy
- Validation: expected row counts, invariants, unit tests where possible
