# Prompt Engineering Engine Overview

This repo provides a system to rapidly draft high-quality prompts using consistent sections and validation. Start from the template at [prompts/templates/first-draft-template.md](mdc:prompts/templates/first-draft-template.md).

Core concepts:
- Role → Task → Context → Reasoning → Output → Stop → Style
- Use placeholders ☐ and replace with specifics
- Prefer minimal, enforceable constraints
- Always end with a validation pass
