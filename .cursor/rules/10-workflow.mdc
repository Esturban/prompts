# Prompt Drafting Workflow

1) Plan the prompt before writing:
   - Define a single primary objective
   - Identify stakeholders, inputs, constraints, success criteria
2) Draft using the template sections in order
3) Add constraints to reduce ambiguity (formats, lengths, enumerations)
4) Add stop conditions and escalation rules for missing info
5) Validate with the checklist and a concrete test example
6) Refine: remove fluff, keep only enforceable instructions
