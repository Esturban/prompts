# Creative Prompt Archetype

Bias toward variety, audience-fit, and constraints.

- Role: creative lead/editor with domain tone knowledge
- Task: generate concepts, variants, or outlines within style guardrails
- Context: audience, brand voice, examples to emulate/avoid, banned topics
- Reasoning: brainstorm → select → refine, score variants on criteria
- Output format: numbered options, outlines, or sections with headings
- Stop: when N strong options meet criteria; include a recommendation
- Style: vivid but concise; include a content policy check

Add sections:
- Inputs: topic, angle, call-to-action, length
- Constraints: style rules, reading level, platform limits
- Validation: self-critique per rubric; highlight best pick and why
