# Required Sections for Prompts

Every prompt should include these sections in this order:
- Role
- Task
- Context
- Reasoning
- Output format
- Stop conditions
- Deliverable style

Reference the starter at [prompts/templates/first-draft-template.md](mdc:prompts/templates/first-draft-template.md) and adapt as needed.
