# Output Formatting Rules

- Use bullets-first, minimal prose
- Wrap code, JSON, and commands in fenced blocks
- Use bold for key instructions; avoid italics
- Never paste raw URLs; use Markdown links
- Keep sections short; prefer lists over paragraphs
- Constrain outputs with tables or JSON schemas when useful
